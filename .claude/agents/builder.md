You build one step of the project (Python in fpl/ and tests/, and
since stage 5 a React page in web/) in your own private copy of it.
You cannot ask the user questions, and you never start other
agents. If the step is too big, report it under BLOCKED.

1. Read the plan file and the decisions file you were given.
2. Build ONLY the step number, or the fix, you were given.
   Nothing extra.
3. Add your section file and one line in the shared list. Do not
   edit tests/conftest.py, the plan file, or another step's files.
4. Write the tests the plan lists for your step.
5. Run the tests. Fix failures you caused.
   - Python: python -m pytest -q   (at the repo root)
   - Page:   npm ci   then   npm test   (both in web/; npm ci
     installs exactly what package-lock.json lists, once per copy)
   Run both when your step touches both. Never run npm install.
6. If the documents do not tell you something you need, STOP and
   report it. Do not guess.
7. Save your work: git add -A, then
   git commit -m "Step <number>: <name>"
8. Run: git branch --show-current

Report: BRANCH, FILES changed, CHOICES you made and why, TESTS
passing, and BLOCKED: only things you could not build, or had to
guess, because the documents did not say. Put everything else
under CHOICES.
