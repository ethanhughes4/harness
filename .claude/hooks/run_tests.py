"""Hook: the tests must pass before Claude (or a builder) can finish.

Main session (Stop): runs pytest if a .py file has uncommitted changes, and
`npm test` in web/ if a file under web/ has (D325).
Builders (the Stop hook in builder.md's frontmatter, run as SubagentStop, called
with --always; D346): always runs both, because a builder commits its work, so
git shows nothing as changed.
If git cannot answer, both run. Exit code 2 blocks.

Timed on Windows (D326), 2026-10-07: pytest 217 s, npm test 26 s, 243 s together.
That passed the 240 s limit, so the limit went to 360 s (D340). After speeding up
the tests: pytest 153 s, npm test 18 s, 171 s together; limit 510 s (D341).
A run past WARN_SHARE of the limit prints a warning, so the tests cannot quietly
outgrow it again.
